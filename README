Notes:
I couldn't finish making tangents for parametric parabolas work,
the cartesian ones work fine however.

I made it so that my frog jumps warps to the other side of the screen if it goes out of range.
This is neat, but served up some problems.
During a jump I wanted the parabola to only draw the frogs remaining trajectory,
I also wanted the parabola to warp across the screen like the frog does.
These two things were very difficult to get working together the way my assignment is set up,
so I just made it that the parametric draw mode draws the parabola crossing ther screen,
and the cartesian only draw the frogs remaining trajectory.
Note that the normals and tangents never go across with it as I ran out of time!

I used C++.

My keyboard library is neat imo, you should take a look ;)

Key bindings:
